This folder will contain the generated files after you successfully run the Vagrantfile and the Ansible playbooks.
The generated files are:

1) join-command     # contains the command for the worker nodes to join the cluster
                    # node-playbook.yaml fetches this from here

2) kube-config      # contains the kubectl configuration file
                    # put it under ~/.kube/confg if you want to run commands from your host machine
